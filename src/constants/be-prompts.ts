Specifically, you MUST include a "Request for Proposal (RFP)" and a "Draft Contract with T\'s & C\'s". All documents should clearly reflect the division of responsibilities between the internal team and the subcontractor.' : ''}
The project follows a 9-phase methodology (HMAP). You must assign each document to the most appropriate phase. The phases are:
1.  **Develop Concept Proposal**: Define scope, vision, and high-level objectives.
2.  **List Resources & Skills Needed**: Inventory of roles, skills, external partners, and tooling.
3.  **SWOT Analysis & Support Gathering**: Analyze risks, strengths, weaknesses; secure stakeholder buy-in.
4.  **Kickoff Review & Briefing**: Align team, confirm objectives, and set expectations.
5.  **Initial Planning & Statement of Work (SOW)**: Detail boundaries, deliverables, and constraints.
6.  **Preliminary Design Review**: Formal review of the SOW and initial plans.
7.  **Develop Detailed Plans & Timeline**: Create WBS, task lists, and milestones.
8.  **Sprint & Critical Design Planning**: Define sprint-level requirements and conduct final design review.
9.  **Deployment Review & Execution Start**: Final readiness check before starting work.

CRITICAL: You MUST include the following six core HMAP documents, assigned to their correct phases as specified below:
- "Concept Proposal" (must be in phase 1)
- "Resources & Skills List" (must be in phase 2)
- "SWOT Analysis" (must be in phase 3)
- "Kickoff Briefing" (must be in phase 4)
- "Statement of Work (SOW)" (must be in phase 5)
- "Detailed Plans (WBS/WRS)" (must be in phase 7)

CRITICAL: The list MUST also include at least one formal review checklist document, such as "Preliminary Design Review" (Phase 6) or "Critical Design Review" (Phase 8).

In addition to these core documents, add more documents that are highly specific and standard for the "${discipline}" discipline to meet the total count of ${docCount}. For example, for "Software Development", you might add "Technical Design Specification" and "User Story Backlog". For "Construction", you might add "Permit Applications" and "Bill of Materials". Use your expert knowledge of the discipline to select the most appropriate documents.

Your final output must be a single, raw JSON object, without any surrounding text or markdown formatting. This JSON object must have a single root key named "documents" containing an array of document objects. Each document object must have exactly three keys: "title" (string), "phase" (number), and "sequence" (number). The 'sequence' key must indicate the logical order of generation for documents within the same phase, starting from 1.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARSING AND CONTENT:
1.  **Project Start Date**: The entire project plan MUST begin on or after ${projectStartDate}. All task and milestone dates must be relative to this start date.

3.  **Duration**: The "Tasks" table MUST include a "Duration (days)" column. This value must be correctly calculated as the number of calendar days from the Start Date to the End Date, inclusive.
4.  **Roles**: The "Role" for each task MUST be selected from the roles defined in the "Resources & Skills List" document provided in the context above. Do not invent new roles. If no specific roles are in the context, infer standard roles for the discipline.
5.  **Dependencies**: The "Dependencies" column must contain the exact "Task Name" of one or more preceding tasks, separated by commas, or be empty.
6.  **Markdown Format**: Adhere strictly to the Markdown table format for Tasks and Milestones, and a bulleted list for the WBS. A valid table MUST have a header row and a separator row (e.g., |---|---:|).
7.  **Discipline-Specific Content**: All generated content, including WBS items, tasks, and milestones, must use professional, industry-standard terminology and conventions specific to the '${discipline}' field.
8.  **Sprints**: ${sprintInstruction}
9.  **Sprint Duration**: The duration of each sprint, from the start date of its first task to the end date of its last task, MUST be between 7 and 14 days.
10. **Logical Dependencies**: A task's "Dependencies" must ONLY list tasks that appear earlier in the table.
11. **Required Milestones**: The "Milestones" table MUST include the following specific milestones, with their dates estimated logically based on the task schedule you create: 'Project Start', 'Preliminary Design Review Complete', milestones for each Sprint's completion (e.g., 'Sprint 1 Complete', 'Sprint 2 Complete'), 'Critical Design Review Complete', and 'Project Completion'. You may add other relevant milestones for the discipline as well.
12. **No Commentary**: Your entire response must consist ONLY of the "## WBS", "## Tasks", and "## Milestones" sections. Do not include any introductory or concluding sentences.

The task list MUST include several formal review tasks, such as "Sprint Plan Review" and "Critical Design Review", at appropriate points in the timeline. All dates must be sequential and logical. ${subcontractorInstruction}

## Impact Analysis
- **Estimated Delay:** [Provide a quantitative estimate, e.g., 5-7 business days]
- **Disruption Impact:** [Describe the potential disruption to the team or ongoing work, e.g., High - requires pausing Sprint 2 tasks]

## Affected Documents
[A bulleted list of document titles that require manual updates based on this change.]

## Task Modifications
[A list of task changes. Each line must start with 'ADD:', 'DELETE:', or 'EDIT:'. For 'ADD' and 'EDIT', provide task details in parentheses like this: (Start: YYYY-MM-DD, End: YYYY-MM-DD, Sprint: Sprint Name, Depends On: Task Name). For 'DELETE', just list the task name.]

### 1. [Risk Title 1]
- **Impact:** [Describe the potential negative outcome if this risk is realized. Be specific, e.g., "High - Could cause a 2-week slip in the final delivery date and a $10,000 budget overrun."]
- **Mitigation:** [Suggest a concrete, actionable strategy to reduce the likelihood or impact of this risk. e.g., "Immediately assign a dedicated QA resource to the 'Integration Testing' task and schedule daily check-ins."]

### 2. [Risk Title 2]
- **Impact:** [Description]
- **Mitigation:** [Suggestion]

### 3. [Risk Title 3]
